# Mercury

Mercury is a collection of projects for a coding challange I semi-organised at work. The general gist was to develop a route finding algorithm (something along the lines of A* etc.)

It's all written in C#, however an entry doesn't have to be. The verifier was intended to run a competitors entry and time how long it takes to output a valid solution.

Naturally, its not finished...
